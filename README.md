Let's say you like Bitcoin. You think the valuation will increase..a lot. So you want to put all your money, let's say $50k, into Bitcoin.

You have one problem though, you realize it's still *possible* that things could go south, and you don't want be in financial ruins if this happens. So you determine a net worth threshhold at which your quality of life begins decreasing rapidly, let's say $20k. Technically we could call this a point of inflection on your satisfaction curve as a function of net worth.

So how do you approach this situation? You want as much exposure to Bitcoin as possible, while maintaining minimal risk of ever going below a $20k net worth.
Well, the easiest solution is to put $30k into Bitcoin and leave the other $20k in USD. Problem solved, right? Well, there's an even better solution.

First, it's important to remember how efficient markets function. Market forces are an aggregate of many individuals and entities. Therefore, efficient markets don't have arbitrary asset price points at which the supply and demand relationship changes it's velocity.

Why is this important? Your optimal curve in respect to the risk | reward function of an asset is **different** from the market's optimal curve.
This means that the aggregate *satisfaction* or *dissatisfaction* of market forces is non-zero-sum. Unlike alpha, which is inherently zero-sum.

So, all this is to say that the difference in your satisfaction curve as a function of asset price in contrast to the market's aggregate satisfaction curve means that this is something each entity/individual in the world can theoretically optimize with no competitive forces.


This fundamental concept is why insurance ***can*** be a transaction of mutualism. In most insurance domains, options of coverage are limited to a discrete list of intuitive choices for the buyer. However, the closest instruments for constructing the optimal *insurance policy* for your investment portfolio are options contracts; and options contracts are much more difficult to effectively intuit than traditional insurance.

What is a solution to this problem? Simplifying options contracts into a more digestable and intuitive interface for investors.
